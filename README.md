# OpenCarbon
Emissions reduction technologies and plans, primarily for carbon but all abundant greenhouse gases should also be covered.

## Project Scope
![TerraNexum - Business Flow Model - OpenCarbon](https://github.com/terranexum/OpenCarbon/assets/20586685/f5bca265-7dc6-47f6-8599-8b5e5cd91e10)

## The State of the Art in Direct Air Capture

At present, DAC uses too much energy, and too much of that is still emissions-producing energy, for it to scale fast enough to remove even the hard-to-abate share (around 10%) of overall carbon emissions in the atmosphere.

This 13-page free report offers a comprehensive list of DAC technologies today, and how energy needs, environmental impacts, and costs can be reduced.

## Innovating Low-Cost, Non-Toxic, Carbon-Storing Sorbents for Direct Air Capture

We also have a four-page report mentioned at the end of the above report that outlines the following sections:

1. Quaternary Ammonium (QA) Based Sorbents for Reducing Energy Consumption, Environmental Impact, and Cost
2. Using a Cellulose Backbone
3. Using a Biochar Backbone
4. Protocol for QA-Functionalized Biochar for CO2 Adsorption

To receive a copy of this report, which contains original research and guidance to advance carbon removal, we ask for a contribution to aid our future R&D, which can be made from our [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/terranexum/projects/opencarbon) page.
